\documentclass[a4paper,12pt,twoside]{book}
%
% for a 10 Point UW PhD Thesis with Margin Check
%\documentclass[10pt,margincheck]{withesis}
%
% The margincheck option flags lines which overflow their hbox with a black
%  box at the end of the line.  This usually (but not always) indicates a
%  margin violation on the right margin.  Left margin violations aren't
%  indicated and if the margin violation is large enough, there isn't room
%  for the black box to be visiable.  
%
% This option can be also used in conjunction with the msthesis option.
%
% or for a 12 Point UW Masters Thesis
%\documentclass[12pt,msthesis]{withesis}
%
% or for a 10 Point UW Masters Thesis
%\documentclass[10pt,msthesis]{withesis}
%
% The msthesis option changes the page margins from 1" all around
% (the PhD format) to 1.25" left and 1" remaining margins (MS format).
% The defaults for degree and thesis are changed to be MS and thesis.
% These defaults can be overridden if the margins for the MS thesis
% are desired for other documents.

% To include optional packages, use the \usepackage command.
%  The package epsfig is used to bring in the Encapsulated PostScript
%    figures into the document.
%  The package times is used to change the fonts to Times Roman; however
%    because the times typewriter font looks odd, the original LaTeX
%    Computer Modern font is kept for the typewriter font using
%      \renewcommand{\ttdefault}{cmtt}
%    Note that Times Roman is a PostScript font and therefore, the document
%    cannot be correctly viewed from the *.dvi file.  It should be converted
%    to a *.ps file first and then viewed with a PostScript previewer...
