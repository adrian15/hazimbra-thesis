\section {Zimbra OSE High Availability}
In 

{prelude}
{problem-description}
{ha-schema}

we have seen that Zimbra OSE could be improved by the means of a High Availability system.

In 

{operating-system-installation}
{network-setup}
{zimbra-installation}
{drbd-setup}
{zimbra-drbd-startup-script-disabling}
{corosync-setup}
{pacemaker-setup}
{ha-system-management}

we have seen a practical example on how to achieve this High Availability system.

Finally in {improvements} we have seen how the current setup can be enhaced.
