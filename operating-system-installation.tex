\subsection {Partitioning}
Both virtual machines will have the same partitioning scheme. Both virtual machines have two hard disks.
Assuming a 1.8 Terabyte hard disk in order to setup DRBD-Meta-Disk there's enough with 59 megabytes. We will be on the safe side and setup it with a 150 megabytes size.

Hard Disk 1:
\begin{verbatim}
sda1 / 10GB ext4
sda2 DRBD-Meta-Disk 150MB ext4
sda3 (LVM Partition + Free space for LVM snapshots)
\end{verbatim}

sda3 contains a LVM's Volume Group named zimbra.
This Volume Group has a Logical Volume named zimbra also which doesn't ocuppy the full Volume Group space. The reason is that we reserver some space for snapshots when doing backups.

In our case we did:
\begin{verbatim}
VG zimbra: 1,8 TB

  LV zimbra: 1770 GB
  Free space: 30 GB
\end{verbatim}


Hard Disk 2:
\begin{verbatim}
sdb1 / 2 GB SWAP
\end{verbatim}
